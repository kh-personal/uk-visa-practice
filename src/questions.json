Actually, the 60s was social change. Enlightenment is the 18th century. Let's check the specific Britizen question. It likely refers to 'Social Change' for 60s. If the question says 'politics/philosophy/science', it's describing the Enlightenment. Let's check if the question is True/False. If the statement links 60s to those specific things, it might be False (it should be Enlightenment). *Correction:* The Enlightenment was the 18th century. The Sixties was social laws. I will mark this as False if the description matches the Enlightenment, or check the context. Actually, the snippet says 'True'. Let me re-read. 'The Swinging Sixties was a period of new ideas about politics, philosophy and science.' This sounds like the definition of the Enlightenment. The Sixties was about fashion, music, social laws.
